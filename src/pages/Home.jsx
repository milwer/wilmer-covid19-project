              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

              Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to
              moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
              treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
              medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical
              conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
              respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
              illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously
              ill or die at any age.&nbsp;

              The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
              informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect
              yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre
              apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing
              your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get
              vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

              The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in
              small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or
              breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
              smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory
              etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to
              stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
